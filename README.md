House Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow for predicting house prices based on various property features, using a tabular dataset. It covers data pre-processing, feature engineering, encoding of categorical variables, and regression modeling. The included code is modular and easy to adapt for similar real estate datasets.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset named test.csv, which contains multiple house features per row, such as:

Lot size, number of bedrooms, year built, quality ratings, neighborhood, and more.

Note: The dataset provided does not contain actual house sale prices (target variable) and is suitable for applying a trained model to make predictions or for preprocessing exercises.

data/: Contains the input CSV file.

src/: Main source code for loading data, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

models/: Saved models for reuse or deployment.

requirements.txt: Dependencies to set up your Python environment.

Workflow
Load Data: Read the CSV using pandas.

Preprocessing:

Fill missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical).

Encode categorical variables with one-hot encoding.

Model Training: (If target values available)

Split data into train and test.

Use RandomForestRegressor (or other regression models).

Prediction:

Apply trained model to new/test data.

Model Saving: Use joblib or pickle to persist models.

Setup
1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the necessary libraries with:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib

Or, using requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Prepare Data
Place your test.csv inside the data/ folder.

3. Run Preprocessing & Modeling
Example code snippet (in train.py or Jupyter notebook):

import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data/test.csv')

# Fill missing values
data.fillna(data.median(numeric_only=True), inplace=True)
data.fillna(data.mode().iloc[0], inplace=True)

# Encode categorical variables
categoricals = data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=categoricals)

See full pipeline and modeling steps in the source code for details.

4. Model Training & Prediction
Train the model only if you have a dataset with target values (actual sale prices).

To predict on new data, load your saved model and apply it to the processed test data.

Usage
Clone the repository.

In your terminal, run the scripts in /src as described in the workflow.

Results and model outputs will be printed or saved to the /models directory.

Results
This template is ready for evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, or R² if target data is provided.

Visualization scripts (matplotlib / seaborn) are available for data exploration and model evaluation.
